#Upstream

Upstream remote is a situation you will be in when you have pulled or cloned a repo, made changes and are pushing them 'upstream'

Upstream or downstream discribe the direction of data flow.

Say you pull from the repo, you are downstream of it (its ahead of you in its state) you make changes and surpass the repo's state then you are pushing upstream. At that point you could say the repo is downstream of you.
