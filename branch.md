#Branch

A branch is a parallel and alternate state of a project.

You can branch a project, start making changes adding files deleting. But the master branch remains uneffected by these changes not reflecting them.

So

One folder (your project) can appear in different states, branches allow you to switch between those states.

The magic comes when you merge a branch. You can blend two branches together or merge them. So you branch a main project, break things in safety, get it working, then bring all those changes back into the main project.
