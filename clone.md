#Git Clone

git clone will copy a set of files in the repository (repo) to your local machine and those files will be copied to the location you called git clone. Not just the project files created by a user, but a .git folder full of gitty magic.

#.git directory

This folder tracks changes in files. It holds the history of the project, every commited state is available, you can return to the state of the first commit and your local folder will look like it did then (amazing).
